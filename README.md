# Hey, Three.js!

Getting started with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to do some 3D things in web browsers.

Currently, there are only few things added. I will add more stuff as and when I learn something new in Three.js.

The `main.js` file is entry point here. I will add a new entry in the `tutorialsMap` to mark the latest/current tutorial I did and want to show it on page.

## Development environment

This is a simple [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) scaffolded project with vanilla js preset. Also, I have added [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) just for fun!
